Users should login to the cluster with

ssh username@wi-hpc-dev
DO NOT RUN COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE JOBS ON THE HEAD NODES.

Users should always be requesting resources:

srun --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10G --account=pcom --partition=pcom bash
# or in a SBATCH script

Users are limited to 2 cores and 10G of memory at a time.

The -account and -partition flags are REQUIRED!

Users can access their PCOM share at /wistar/pcom. Jozef Madzo - Italo Tempera is still labeled as the owner of this share, is this still the case?
